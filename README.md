5V to 3.3V Regulator PCB Design (Altium Designer)
This project features the design of a simple two-layer PCB in Altium Designer for voltage regulation from 5V to 3.3V. The design is compact and optimized for low-noise power conversion.

Components Used
Voltage Regulator: MIC5317-3.3YM5-TR
Capacitors: 2 × CMP-03422-000182-1 (1µF, 10V, X7R, 0805)
Connector: 2 × SM02B-GHS-TB(LF)(SN)
Project Features
✔️ Compact PCB layout with two layers
✔️ Efficient voltage regulation from 5V to 3.3V
✔️ Designed for low-noise applications

Files Included
📁 Altium Project Files (.SchDoc, .PcbDoc)
📁 Gerber Files (for PCB fabrication)
📁 BOM (Bill of Materials)

Feel free to explore, modify, and contribute! 🚀
